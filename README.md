## About

Welcome to **LocaleLoom**, where local insights are woven into practical guides for thriving in cities across India and beyond. Starting with Bengaluru, this repository combines insider knowledge, cost information, lifestyle hacks, and travel tips to help you experience urban living to the fullest—whether you're a resident or a visitor.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress. I am adding more cities and expanding existing content. If you have suggestions or want to contribute, please open an issue or a pull request. I've chosen markdown files for all content as they'll be easier to render when I create the project website in the future.
